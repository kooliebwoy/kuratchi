/**
 * Streaming SSR — async boundary support.
 *
 * Enables templates to declare async data via non-awaited calls:
 *
 *   const todos = getTodos();       // AsyncValue<Todo[]>
 *   if (todos.pending) { <Skeleton /> }
 *   if (todos.error)   { <p>{todos.error}</p> }
 *   if (todos.success) { for (const t of todos) { <Todo /> } }
 *
 * The compiler detects these patterns and, for each, calls:
 *
 *   const todos = await __registerBoundary('todos-1', getTodos(), {
 *     pending: (value) => '<skeleton markup>',
 *     success: (value) => '<resolved markup>',
 *     error:   (value) => '<error markup>',
 *   });
 *
 * `__registerBoundary` returns an AsyncValue synchronously so the rest of the
 * template render proceeds with `.pending=true, .error=null, .success=false`.
 * The promise is tracked in a per-request collector on `locals`. After the
 * render function returns its (synchronous, pending-state) HTML, the dispatcher
 * checks the collector. If empty, it responds with the HTML as a plain string
 * — no streaming overhead. If any boundaries are pending, it:
 *
 *   1. Opens a ReadableStream.
 *   2. Emits the initial HTML, injecting a `<script>$_swap=...</script>`
 *      boot helper near the end of `<body>`.
 *   3. Awaits each boundary promise (in parallel — they've already been fired).
 *   4. On each resolution, streams a `<template id="__ssr_chunk_N">{html}</template><script>$_swap(N)</script>`
 *      fragment. The browser runs `$_swap(N)` synchronously on script parse,
 *      which moves the template's content into the pending-state placeholder
 *      div, replacing the skeleton.
 *   5. Closes the stream once all boundaries have resolved.
 *
 * This is the "out-of-order flush" pattern used by React 18 Suspense SSR,
 * Solid's streaming resources, and every other modern streaming SSR framework.
 * It requires no client-side framework — the `$_swap` helper is ~180 bytes
 * of inline JS, and each chunk is self-contained HTML + one-line script.
 *
 * Safe degradation: if the client has JavaScript disabled, the skeletons sit
 * in place until the stream closes; then `<template>` elements appear inert
 * at the end of the body. The user sees skeletons permanently — acceptable,
 * and the overall HTML is still syntactically valid (templates don't render).
 * If we cared about no-JS users, a later enhancement could make the server
 * emit the final resolved HTML inline when it detects `<noscript>` support
 * is desired — out of scope for now.
